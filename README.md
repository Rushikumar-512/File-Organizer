# File Organizer (Python)

This is a small Python project I created to organize files in a folder automatically.  
It helps clean up messy folders by moving files into separate folders based on their type (like Images, Documents, Videos, etc.).  
I made this project to practice working with the `os` and `shutil` modules in Python.

## Features
- Automatically sorts files into folders based on their extensions  
- Creates folders such as Images, Documents, Music, Videos, and Others  
- Skips already organized files to avoid duplicates  
- Works for any folder you select  
- Simple and easy to use from the command line  

## How to Run
1. Install Python 3 on your computer.  
2. Download or clone this repository:
   ```bash
